How to run the code - 
solver.py <input_file_name> <output_file_name> <ttl> <cur_seed>
  
 Parameters - 
 input_file_name - the path to the input fil
 Output_file_name - the path where the solver will place the solution file 
 ttl - time to run the code. The time is determined by the challenge type (all time best or restricted resources) 
 cur_seed - the seed to run the code with. The late instances of the restricted resources challenge should run on a list of seeds provided by the challenge organizers.
